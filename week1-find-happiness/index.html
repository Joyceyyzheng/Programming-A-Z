        <p>Sample Text:</p>Even before Rat entered, he knew what the menu would be: Brown Windsor soup, roast Norfolk
        turkey with chipolatas, followed by sherry trifle, some dry cheddar, coffee extra. He arrived first in order to
        check that the private room he had booked was properly laid up. Rather to his surprise, the appearance of the
        room (called the Isis Room) was excellent, the table laid with a gleaming white starched cloth and napkins,
        sparkling glasses and heavy, old-fashioned cutlery.
